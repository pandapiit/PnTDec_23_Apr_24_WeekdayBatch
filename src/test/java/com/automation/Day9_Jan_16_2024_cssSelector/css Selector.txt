css Selector

//html[@attribute = 'value']
html[attribute = value]


if there is an id attribute then css Selector then we can use # symbol

html#idattributevalue - this one is more recommended because it has a higher chance of 1 of 1
#idattributevalue

input#login1


what if there is a class ?? then we use symbol .
html.classattributevalue

cssSelectors are more convenient to use if it is a compound class

html.value1.value2.value3.value4.value5.valuen
div.hidden-sm.hidden-md.hidden-lg.col-xs-12.form-group.remove-padding.ng-star-inserted


cssSelectors you cannot travel from bottom to top. That is only possible in Xpath

//how to traverse between siblings
in cssSelector to traverse between siblings you have to use + symbol
in cssSelector to traverse between grandparent > parent > child - exactly family you have to use  >  symbol or a space

a parent can have multiple kids. Sometimes kids of the same html tag type
kids of the same type are known as nth-of-type(1)
total kids are represented by nth-child(4)


p#signin_info > a:nth-child(1) - signin link
p#signin_info > a:nth-of-type(1)
p#signin_info a:nth-child(1)


p#signin_info > br:nth-child(2)
p#signin_info > a + br
p#signin_info a:nth-child(1) + br


p#signin_info > a:nth-child(3) - create account link
p#signin_info > a:nth-of-type(2)
p#signin_info > a + br + a
p#signin_info a:nth-child(1) + br + a
p#signin_info a:nth-child(1) + br:nth-child(2) + a
p#signin_info a:nth-child(1) + br:nth-child(2) + a:nth-child(3)
