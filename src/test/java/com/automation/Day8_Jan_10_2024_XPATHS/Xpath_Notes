Relative Xpath
--------------
has certain syntaxes. We have to practice those syntaxes

What are the conditions you need to satisfy to write Relative Xpath?
//1. You need to know where to write Xpath
//2. Ctrl+F in your webpage
//3. Write Xpath in the editor
//4. Make sure it is 1 of 1
//5. if it shows 0 of 0 that means your xpath is incorrect


1st syntax - most basic syntax
//htmltag[@attribute = 'valueofthatattribute']
//a[@class = 'signin']

2nd syntax -
//htmltag[@attribute1 = 'value' and  @attribute2 = 'value']
//input[@id = 'login1' and @name = 'login']
//input[@id = 'password' and @name = 'passwd']
//input[@name = 'proceed' and @class = 'signinbtn']

3rd syntax
//htmltag[@attribute1 = 'value' or  @attribute2 = 'value']
//input[@id = 'login1' or @name = 'login']
//input[@id = 'password' or @name = 'passwd']
//input[@name = 'proceed' or @class = 'signinbtn']

4th syntax (related mostly to links)
//htmltag[text() = 'valueofthetext']

5th & 6th syntax (used for links as well as other WebElements) - popular syntax
//htmltag[contains(text(), 'valueofthetext')] - mostly used for links
//htmltag[contains(@attribute, 'valueoftheattribute')] - this is used for other WebElements
