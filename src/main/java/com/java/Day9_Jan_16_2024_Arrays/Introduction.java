	//Data Structure (memory storage) and Algorithms (but an intelligent logic)
	
	//Arrays- it is a very straight forward concept
	//Array is a data-structure/object that contains homogeneous[same data type] elements
	//Length of the array is determined/decided at the time of creation and one created it remains fixed
	//indexing position of an array starts from zero and if there are total n elements the last element will be inside (n-1)th position
	//10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100
	
	//element 10 is in 0th position
	//element 100 is in (10-1) = 9th position
	
	//Features of Arrays
	//1. indexing position starts from 0
	//2. any java array variable can be declared like other variables but the representational form is a dimension which is []
	
	int a = 30; //here a is simply a variable of int datatype
	int b[] = {10,20,30}; //here b is an array variable of int type
	
	//3. all the variables in the array are ordered
	//4. since arrays are objects, they occupy memory space
	//5. parent class of Array is Object Class
	//6. arrays are always created at Runtime
	//7. you want to determine the length of an array - you have to use a member known as length
	
	//Advantages of Array
	//1. store multiple data items using a single name
	int c = 10;
	int c1[] = {10, 20, 30, 40 , 50, 60, 70};
	//2. We can access any element of the array using the indexes.
	//3. Arrays can be used to implement other data structures such as LinkedLists, Stacks, Queues, Graphs, Trees, etc.
	//4. Primitive data types conversion to Wrapper Class Objects will not happen in case of arrays. Hence they are faster in operation.
	
	//Disadvantages of Array
	//1. Fixed size
	//2. memory wastage
	//3. Strongly typed - which is pre-defined
	//4. Arrays do not have any kind of add or remove methods
	
	//What kind of Arrays we should learn?
	//1-D array
	//2-D array
	//3-D array
	//Jagged array
	//Object array
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
	}
	

	
	
	
	
	
	
	public static void method1() {
	
      //we are working in a University
	  //University has 10000 students
	  //manage the student data - job
