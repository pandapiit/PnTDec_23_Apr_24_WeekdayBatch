	//Criteria 2 - Should be in the same class
	//Criteria 3 - Parameters / Arguments should be different
	
	
	
	
	//2. Method Overriding/ RunTime Polymorphism / Dynamic Polymorphism / Dynamic Binding 
	//How to achieve Method Overriding?
	//Criteria 1 - Method name should be the same
	//Criteria 2 - Class name will be different
	//Criteria 3 - Arguments will be the same
