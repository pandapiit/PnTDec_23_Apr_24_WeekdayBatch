	/*Child class of List Interface
	  All the methods of Parent interfaces are inherited
	 Purpose - Grouping individual objects
	
	
	
	 
	 
	 
	 ArrayList is a re-sizable Array
	 We can either add or remove the objects from the ArrayList
	 Heterogeneous objects are allowed by default 
	 Storing specific type of objects by specifying the wrapper classes, String, Objects etc. 
	 Primitive data types cannot be provided in Generics
	 Its not mandatory to provide the generic type at the object creation end
	  Removing all the ArrayList objects at a go using clear() method
	 Checking whether the ArrayList is Empty using isEmpty() method
	 Checking whether the provided object is available in the ArrayList using contains() method
	 Converting an ArrayList to Array using toArray() method
	 Adding at a particular index using add(index,object) method
	 Removing the object at a particular index using remove(index) method
	 Setting the required object at a particular index using set(index,newObject)
	  This will return the replaced object
	 Retrieving the index position of the given object using indexOf(Object) method
	 This will return -1 in case the given object is not available
	 Retrieving the last occurrence index of the duplicated object in the ArrayList using lastIndexOf(Object) method
	 Assigning the object of ArrayList to Collection interface
	 Assigning the object of ArrayList to List interface
	 Using Collections.sort() for soring the ArrayList objects
	 Using iterator() method with ArrayList
	 Using listIterator() method with ArrayList
	 Best suitable when your frequent operation is retrieval
	 Not suitable when your frequent operation is adding or removal of objects in between the ArrayList */
