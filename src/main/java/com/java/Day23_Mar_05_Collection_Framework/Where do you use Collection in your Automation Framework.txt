Where do you use Collection in your Automation Framework?

Answer:

1) Map: Map stores the data in Key and value format.

In automation Testing map can be used to pass the user data value for login page or for registration Page

For Example, we are passing the user details like name, e-mail, contact no etc in data table in feature file, while using BDD Approach.
Then in step-definition file we must convert data table in to Map and we can retrieve the values from the map.

2) Set : Duplicates are not allowed in the set. So it will store only unique element. Mainly used for Searching Operation.

The most common use of Set Interface is to handle all opened windows which are the child windows by web driver. To handle we use getWindowHandles( ) method which return the Set of String. By iterating through this set, we can identify and store the handles of all currently open windows.

// getWindowHandle method to get ID of new window (child window)
Set<String> Child_id = driver.getWindowHandles();

// for each loop
for (String a : Child_id)
{
// it will print IDs of both window
System.out.println(a);
}


3) List : List is used when we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity, where duplicates are allowed and insertion order must be preserved.

Finding all the links and finding all the requested tags are common examples where we can use List Interface.

List Interface in Automation Testing is used with findelements() methods. findelements() methods return the list of Webelemenets.

List<WebElement> plants = driver.findElements(By.tagName("li"));
for (WebElement element : elements)
{
System.out.println("Paragraph text:" + element.getText());
}

4) Queue: Queue Interface is used when we want to do some kind of operation in FIFO form, Like Sending a message to 10 Persons as per the sheet order.
Example:
a) When we want to send the mail to all Testerâ€™s mailid available in excel sheet.
b) When we want to update the excel sheet data cell-wise.
