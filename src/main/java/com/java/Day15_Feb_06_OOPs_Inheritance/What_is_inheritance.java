	//Inheritance is inheriting properties of Parent Class into Child Class
	//Inheritance in java is a mechanism in which one Object(child) acquires all the properties and behaviors of the the Parent Object
	//Inheritance represents IS-A relationship which is also known as Parent-Child relationship
	
	//Example 1:
	//Let's say parent Class is Animal
	//Dog IS-A Animal
	//Cow IS-A Animal
	//Cat IS-A Animal
	
	//Example 2:
	//Let's say parent Class is Doctor
	//Surgeon            IS-A Doctor
	//MedicineSpecialist IS-A Doctor
	
	//What are the advantages of inheritance?
	//1. Code reusability
	//2. It promotes runtime Polymorphism [ method overriding ]
	
	//What are the disadvantages of inheritance?
	//1. Parent Class and Child Class get tightly coupled
	
	//Which entities do not take part in inheritance?
	//1. Private members of a Class
	//2. Constructors
	
	//What are the types of inheritance?
	//1. Single Inheritance - One Child class extends one Parent Class
	//2. Multilevel Inheritance - GrandParent is extended by Parent which is extended by Child
	//3. Hierarchical Inheritance - One Parent class is extended by Multiple Child  classes
