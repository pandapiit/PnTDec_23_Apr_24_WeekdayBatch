public class What_Is_Encapsulation {
	
	//Bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit [Class]
	//Hiding implementation details of a Class from outside access
	//Whatever access you want to give - that is upto the developer
	
	//How do we achieve this in Java?
	//1. All the instance variables - declare them as private. So what happens is these private members can only be accessed within the class.
	//2. To allow outside entities access to the instance variables, public methods known as getters and setters are defined.These methods
	//    are used to retrieve and modify the values of the instance variables.
	
	//What is the consequence of creating setters and getters methods?
	//The class - it can enforce its own data validation rules
	
	//Advantages:
	
	//1. Data Hiding[increasing security]
	//2. Flexibility
	//3. Accessibility
	//4. Resubality
	//5. Testing code will become somewhat easier
