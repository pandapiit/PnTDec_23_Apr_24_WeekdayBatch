//Difference no 1 - Constructor has to have the ClassName, method can have any name
//Differene no 2 - Methods have to have a return type, constructor has no return type not even void.
//Difference no 3 - Constructor cannot be declared static but methods can be declared as static
//Difference no 4 - A constructor is invoked the moment an Object is created, that is not the case with methods
//Difference no 5 - Constructors can only be overloaded, but not overridden whereas methods can do both
